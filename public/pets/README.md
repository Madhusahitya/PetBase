# Pet Images Directory

This directory contains the 3D cartoonish pet images for the PetBase application.

## Required Images

Please add the following image files to this directory:

1. **puppy.png** - The light brown, friendly puppy with floppy ears and a collar
2. **kitten.png** - The orange tabby cat with blue eyes and a waving paw
3. **dragon.png** - The orange dragon with purple wings and antennae

## Image Specifications

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Size**: Recommended 256x256 pixels or higher
- **Style**: 3D cartoonish, smooth, rounded appearance
- **Background**: Transparent

## How to Add Images

1. Save your pet images with the exact filenames: `puppy.png`, `kitten.png`, `dragon.png`
2. Place them in this directory: `public/pets/`
3. The application will automatically use these images instead of emoji pets
4. If images fail to load, the app will fallback to emoji pets (🐕🐱🐉)
