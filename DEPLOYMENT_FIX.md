# Deployment Fix

This file was added to force Vercel to use the latest commit that has the AirdropSystem component completely removed.

## Changes Made:
- Deleted components/AirdropSystem.tsx
- Removed all AirdropSystem imports and references
- Fixed all TypeScript errors

## Status: Ready for deployment
